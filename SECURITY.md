## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to security@stablecoin-protocol.dev (replace with actual email).

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receiving the report
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours, we will confirm the issue and provide an initial assessment
- **Fix Development**: Critical issues will be prioritized for immediate patching
- **Public Disclosure**: After a fix is deployed, we will coordinate responsible disclosure

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with multi-sig governance
- **Reentrancy Protection**: OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard on all external functions
- **Oracle Security**: Multi-source price feeds with staleness and deviation checks
- **Flash Loan Protection**: Multi-block operations and commit-reveal timing
- **Emergency Systems**: Circuit breakers and pause mechanisms

### Development Security

- **Static Analysis**: Slither integration in CI/CD pipeline
- **Test Coverage**: >95% code coverage with edge case testing
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical economic invariants
- **External Audits**: Professional security reviews before mainnet deployment

### Operational Security

- **Multi-sig Governance**: Critical parameter changes require multiple signatures
- **Timelock Contracts**: 72-hour delay on governance proposals
- **Monitoring Systems**: Real-time anomaly detection and alerting
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents

## Bug Bounty Program

We run a bug bounty program for security researchers:

- **Scope**: All smart contracts in the `/contracts` directory
- **Rewards**: Up to $50,000 for critical vulnerabilities
- **Platform**: [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com) (link to be added when live)

### Vulnerability Classifications

| Severity | Description | Reward Range |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Critical | Remote code execution, complete protocol drainage | $25,000 - $50,000 |
| High | Significant fund loss, system unavailability | $10,000 - $25,000 |
| Medium | Limited fund loss, temporary DoS | $2,500 - $10,000 |
| Low | Information disclosure, minor issues | $500 - $2,500 |
