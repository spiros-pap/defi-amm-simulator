## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-15

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Production Release

This release marks the completion of the core stablecoin lending protocol with MEV-resistant liquidations.

### Added

#### Core Protocol
- **Stablecoin Contract**: ERC20 stablecoin with role-based minting controls
- **VaultManager**: Multi-collateral CDP management system
- **LiquidationEngine**: MEV-resistant commit-reveal batch auction system
- **StabilityPool**: Liquidation liquidity backstop mechanism
- **PriceOracle**: Secure price feeds with multiple validation layers

#### Collateral Support  
- **ERC4626Adapter**: Support for yield-bearing vault tokens (wstETH, rETH, etc.)
- **RebasingAdapter**: Normalization for rebasing tokens (stETH, etc.)
- **GuardedOracle**: Enhanced oracle security with circuit breakers
- **WadMath Library**: Precise decimal arithmetic for DeFi operations

#### Security Features
- **Reentrancy Protection**: OpenZeppelin guards on all external functions
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with multi-sig governance
- **Oracle Security**: Staleness checks, deviation bounds, TWAP validation
- **Flash Loan Resistance**: Multi-block operations prevent atomic exploitation
- **Emergency Systems**: Circuit breakers and pause mechanisms

#### Development & Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 95%+ coverage across all components
  - Unit tests for individual contract functionality
  - Integration tests for cross-contract interactions  
  - Security tests for access controls and attack resistance
  - Gas optimization tests and benchmarks
- **Static Analysis Integration**: Slither security analysis in CI pipeline
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical liquidation logic

#### Deployment & Operations
- **Hardhat-Deploy Integration**: Production-ready deployment scripts
- **Multi-Network Support**: Hardhat local, Sepolia testnet, mainnet ready
- **Configuration Scripts**: Automated protocol parameter setup
- **Verification Tools**: Post-deployment validation and health checks
- **Simulation Framework**: Complete liquidation scenario testing

#### Documentation
- **Architecture Guide**: Comprehensive system design documentation
- **Liquidation Mechanics**: Detailed commit-reveal auction explanation
- **Threat Model**: Security analysis and mitigation strategies
- **ADR-01**: Architectural decision record for liquidation design
- **API Documentation**: Complete interface and usage documentation

### Security Considerations

- **Audit Status**: Internal security review completed
- **Known Limitations**: See threat model for current assumptions
- **Recommended Actions**: External audit recommended before mainnet deployment

### Technical Specifications

- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.24
- **Hardhat Version**: 3.x with viem integration
- **Test Framework**: Mocha/Chai with Hardhat Network Helpers
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimized for reasonable mainnet costs
- **Code Coverage**: 95%+ across all critical paths

### Deployment Networks

- âœ… **Hardhat Local**: Fully supported with mock contracts
- âœ… **Sepolia Testnet**: Complete deployment and testing
- ðŸŸ¡ **Mainnet**: Ready for deployment (pending external audit)
